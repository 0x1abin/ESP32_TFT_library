#### Features

* Full support for **ILI9341** & **ILI9488** based TFT modules in 4-wire SPI mode. Support for other controllers will be added later
* **18-bit (RGB)** color mode used
* **SPI displays oriented SPI driver library** based on *spi-master* driver
* Combined **DMA SPI** transfer mode and **direct SPI** for maximal speed
* **Grayscale mode** can be selected during runtime which converts all colors to gray scale
* SPI speeds up to **40 MHz** are tested and works without problems
* **Demo application** included which demonstrates most of the library features

  * **TFT_drawPolygon**  Draw poligon on screen with given number of sides (3~60). Can be outlined with different color and rotated by given angle.
* **Fonts**:
  * **fixed** width and proportional fonts are supported; 8 fonts embeded
  * unlimited number of **fonts from file**
  * **7-segment vector font** with variable width/height is included (only numbers and few characters)
  * Proportional fonts can be used in fixed width mode.
  * Related functions:
    * **TFT_setFont**  Set current font from one of embeded fonts or font file

    * Strings can be printed at **any angle**. Rotation of the displayed text depends on *font_ratate* variable (0~360)
    * if *font_transparent* variable is set to 1, no background pixels will be printed
    * If the text does not fit the screen/window width it will be clipped ( if *text_wrap=0* ), or continued on next line ( if *text_wrap=1* )
    * Two special characters are allowed in strings: *\r* CR (0x0D), clears the display to EOL, *\n* LF (ox0A), continues to the new line, x=0

Full functions **syntax and descriptions** can be found in *tft.h* and *tftspi.h* files.

Full **demo application**, well documented, is included, please **analyze it** to learn how to use the library functions.

---

#### Connecting the display

To run the demo, attach ILI9341 or ILI9488 based display module to ESP32. Default pins used are:
* mosi: 23
* miso: 19
*  sck: 18
*   CS:  5 (display CS)
*   DC: 26 (display DC)
*  TCS: 25 (touch screen CS)


**If you want to use different pins, change them in** *tftspi.h*

**if you want to use the touch screen functions, set** `#define USE_TOUCH 1` in *tftspi.h*

Using *make menuconfig* **select tick rate 1000** ( → Component config → FreeRTOS → Tick rate (Hz) ) to get more accurate timings

---

#### How to build

Configure your esp32 build environment as for **esp-idf examples**

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/loboris/ESP32_TFT_library.git`

Execute menuconfig and configure your Serial flash config and other settings. Included *sdkconfig.defaults* sets some defaults to be used.

Navigate to **TFT Display DEMO Configuration** and set **SPIFFS** options.

Select if you want to use **wifi** (recommended) to get the time from **NTP** server and set your WiFi SSID and password.

`make menuconfig`

Make and flash the example.

`make all && make flash`

---

#### Prepare **SPIFFS** image

*The demo uses some image and font files and it is necessary to flash the spiffs image*

**To flash already prepared image to flash** execute:

`make copyfs`

---

You can also prepare different SFPIFFS **image** and flash it to ESP32. *This feature is only tested on Linux.*

Files to be included on spiffs are already in **components/spiffs_image/image/** directory. You can add or remove the files you want to include.

Then execute:

`make makefs`

to create **spiffs image** in *build* directory **without flashing** to ESP32

Or execute:

`make flashfs`

to create **spiffs image** in *build* directory and **flash** it to ESP32
